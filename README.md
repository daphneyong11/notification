# Flutter Notification (Firebase and local notification)
A minimal reproducible code sample for flutter plugin firebase messaging (notification) and local notification. 
Problem occured:
When flutter run in release mode, the notification custom sound is not played(foreground, background and terminated state). When in foreground, the notification icon is not shown (turn into black).
*Please register your own google-services.json in firebase console and add in android/app folder.
